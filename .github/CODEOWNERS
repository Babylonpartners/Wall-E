# Global rule for the whole codebase.
#  - Every PR needs to be reviewed by at least one member of the `ios-bot-owners` team.
#  - The empty `iOS-PullAssigner` team will act as a proxy for the PullAssigner bot.
#    When a new PR arrives, PullAssigner will be triggered, which will then pick members from the iOS-Admin team
